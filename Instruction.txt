This script package was developed for pulsar search on multi-core CPU servers by Presto. Developers are Jianwen Wei, Chenfei Zhang and James Lin from SJTU; Zhongli Zhang, Tao An and Ting Yu from SHAO. The script has been tested on SHAO SKA prototype machine, both on X86 and ARM CPU nodes, for pulsar search with MWA incoherently summed observations. 

To use this script for other purpose, the parameters in the script need to be adjusted based on your needs, e.g., ddplan method, dm(max), zmax,...

In this folder:
1) fastffts.c, fftcall.c, minifft.c, rfifind.c, presto.h, ransomfft.h are OpenMP parallel running scripts for rfifind, prepsubband.c is OpenMP parallel running script for de-dispersion. Need to copy them to cover old files (in presto "src" and "include" folders) then recompile presto.

2) load_balance.py is to distribute commands to processes for multiprocessing de-dispersion. Run this program first then fix dedispersion.py manually (will update soon).

3) accelsearch.py, dedispersion.py, prepfold.py are parallel scripts for individual use if needed, in which line 10 can adjust the parallel core number.

4) single_pulse_search_opt.py is parallel running script for individual use if needed, in which line 506 can adjust parallel core number.

5) autosearch_pulsar3.2opt.py is parallel running script for the whole search. Use makesearch3.2.sh to run it, while line 6 in makesearch3.2.sh can adjust parallel core number.

With our experience, it is suggested to use up all the cores of one node at once.

makesearch3.2.sh is written for a certain project of MWA. Please rewrite it for your own needs, and learn how to submit it under rules of SHAO SKA prototype or other servers.
